I accomplished the internship at FMC technologies and worked as an engineer at a research science company.

My current research is about the correspondence between the mathematical models and the measured riverine sediment data. I enjoy working with data and models, which helps to develop theory and make new conclusions and assumptions or proof the existing one.
I enjoy reading, walking, and spending time with my family and I have a lot of hobbies, like photos, music (worked as DJ), movies, etc.
