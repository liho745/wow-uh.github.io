A realistic runoff routing model captures temporal and spatial variability of streamflow [for example, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART; Li et al., 2013)] which affects water balance and other land processes in ESM. A dynamic and optimal reservoir operation rule that considers uncertainties can address the non-stationarity which arises from climate change.  Similarly, reservoirs' water management has a direct impact on streamflow and its temperature (Li et al., 2015). This prompts a further understanding of reservoirs, in a stratified form, to analyze the extent of their impact on stream temperature.

Physical and virtual water transfer can be analyzed through a global water-food-energy nexus study. As the Spatio-temporal distribution of water changes, it is important to look at global surface water quality and quantity by employing global river routing and stream temperature models.
