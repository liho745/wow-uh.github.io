Taher and two of his peers will be holding a workshop at the *2022 Geospatial Water
Technology Conference*, held by American Water Resources Association (AWRA), in Austin, TX.
This one-day workshop is titled "*R and Python Tools for Geospatial Water Applications Workshop*"
and will be held on May, 8th, 2022.

More information about the workshop and registration can be found
[here](https://www.awra.org/Members/Events_and_Education/Events/2022_GIS_Conference/2022_GWTC_Workshops.aspx).

## Abstract

This session and coupled workshop will cover a suite of free and open-source geospatial water data access and manipulation tools in both the python and R programming languages. The session will provide a high-level overview of packages and their capabilities using example applications as context and background. The workshop will be a hands-on opportunity to use the packages for sample applications and to interact with the package authors.
