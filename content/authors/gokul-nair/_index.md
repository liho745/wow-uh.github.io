After graduating from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering, I joined Dr. Hong-Yi Liâ€™s PhD program, looking to specialize in Earth System Modeling. I am currently focusing on utilizing hydrological principles to develop a large-scale mosquito model. 
Outside of research, I love reading fiction and mythology books, and playing games.
